# Lecture 2
# Program task number 1
# This program meows like a cat

# Starter code
# Prints meow out 3 times
print("Meow!")
print("Meow!")
print("Meow!")

# Using a loop to print meow out 3 times
i = 3  # i is a variable that keeps track of how many times we have printed meow, initialised to 3
while i != 0:      # While i is not equal to 0, keep printing meow
    print("Meow!")
    i = i - 1      # Without this line, the loop will run forever, as i will never be equal to 0
