### About this Repository
This repository contains all course work done during this free code camp course. Each file includes each iteration of changes as you go from the basic steps of a task, to how to simplify your code with different methods. Each file contains comments explaining the steps as I work through the course as a way of providing a place to check and understand the core concepts of python.
