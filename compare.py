# Lecture 1
# Program task number 1
# program to test using conditionals

# Asks the users for the values of x and y
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# Conditionals to check if x is less than y, greater than y or equal to y
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
if x ==y:
    print("x is equal to y")
